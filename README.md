This is my first major project I've done in Python. After a few years of trying to learn it with my dad, we decided to make our own game to test and practice new concepts. It's already taught me a lot of stuff including classes, how to import other python files, and more detailed methods of doing basic tasks. Once it's finished, it will be a good credit to show future employers.
